# LightshotScraper

== INTRODUCTION ==
- Simple bash script to scrape and store screenshots from Lightshot / prnt.sc.
- Seems there's a lot of "interesting" things in there. Private crypto keys, API keys, sensitive financial details, passwords, etc.

== INSTRUCTIONS ==
- Go get a valid CF token and add it in line 10.

== TODO ==
- Find an AI/ML wizard who can automate the agonizing process of sorting out the contents.

== DISCLAIMERS ==

- If you try to multithread this, you're gonna have a bad time.
- You're about to go down into the internet's deepest underbelly of strangeness. Words cannot describe it. You've been warned.
- I'm not responsible if you get yourself in trouble because you did something stupid with this. Don't be stupidâ„¢.
- Probably very unsuitable to those under 18, and those who are easily offended.
- CALIFORNIA PROP 65 WARNING:
    THIS BASH SCRIPT COULD HYPOTHETICALLY CAUSE YOUR CPU TO EMIT ZERO OR MORE UNITS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT AFFECT YOUR LIFETIME CHANCES OF GETTING CANCER.
